# Discord sci-hub bot

Lets users of your server download papers from sci-hub.
After adding the bot, send "$sh paperlink_or_DOI" and the bot will attempt to grab and upload the paper from sci-hub's servers.
It uses TOR on the backend as proxies cost money and sci-hub has very aggressive anti-bot measures ðŸ˜‚
